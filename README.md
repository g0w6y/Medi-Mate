- Care is **fragmented**:
  - Elders forget doses and struggle with tech.
  - Caretakers are overloaded and lack structured accountability.
  - Families are anxious due to lack of real-time visibility.
  - Doctors rarely get clean adherence/vitals data.
- Existing apps fail in India:
  - Not **offline-first**
  - No **local language support**
  - No **SOS/emergency integration**
